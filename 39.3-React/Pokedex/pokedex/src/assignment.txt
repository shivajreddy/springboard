Modify your component hierarchy so that App renders a
component called Pokegame. Pokegame should take your list
of 8 pokemon and randomly assign them into two hands of
4 cards each. It should then render two Pokedex components,
one for each hand.

Once you’ve got this working, modify your Pokegame so that
it also calculates the total experience for each hand of
pokemon. It should pass this total to the Pokedex.

Next, have the Pokegame component determine which hand is
the “winner,” where the winning hand is the one with the
higher total experience. Then modify the Pokedex component
one more time so that it accepts a prop of isWinner. If the
Pokedex is the winning one, it should display the
message “THIS HAND WINS!” at the bottom of the deck.

Now when you load the page, you should see two
different hands with a randomly changing winner
every time you refresh.

Styling
Add styling to your components — perhaps you can
do interesting things when hovering over a Pokecard, or
have them smoothly transition into the page, all via CSS?
