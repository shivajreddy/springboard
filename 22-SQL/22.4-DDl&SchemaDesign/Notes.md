# Part 2: Schema Critique

## Schema One: Outer Space

There can be a table for galaxies, and the planets can reference to the galaxies table

Similarly, Moons also can have their own table, and be referenced in planers table

**So create moons, galaxies tables before referencing them in the planets table.**
