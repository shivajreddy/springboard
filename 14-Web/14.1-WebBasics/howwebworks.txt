1. HTTP is a protocol. Hyper Text Transfer protocol

2. URL -> Uniform Resource Locator. A location (unique) for a resource.

3. DNS -> Domain Name System. Like a phonebook, which ip address for the human readable domain or URL

4. Queury String -> dynamic content at a given resource. queries are in key-value pair.
They start at the end of the url with '?' and multiple quries are separated by '&'

5. HTTP verbs -> GET request: this is a request from client side to the server through a HTTP protocol
POST request: this is a request to post something from client side on to the server through a HTTP protocol

6. HTTP request is a request done by client to the server, that follows the HTTP protocol

7. HTTP response is HTTP protocol response, responded by the server for a request to the client.

8. HTTP Header: this has the information related to the request/response.
For request headers: Cache, cookies
For Response headers: content-type: if it's html or json, cache, set-cookies, session

9. The browser looks at the DNS and identifies('resolves') the IP address to make a request to.
Browser then makes the request to that IP address along with the request headers.
The server receives the request, processes it, and responds back with a response resource along with response header.
The browser then makes the Document Object Model from the response resource (using html,css,js files), ex. v12 is the engine that chrome uses,
this engine is responsible for creating the DOM on google chrome browser.
In the response received if there are other requests (almost always yes) like link:styles, src:img, all these resources are
again requested asynchronously.
